Question 1
How do you add a 1 dimensional convolution to your model for predicting time series data?



1 / 1 point

Use a 1DConv layer type


Use a Conv1D layer type (yes)


Use a Convolution1D layer type


Use a 1DConvolution layer type

Correct
2.
Question 2
What’s the input shape for a univariate time series to a Conv1D? 

1 / 1 point

[1]


[1, None]


[None, 1] (yes)


[]

Correct
3.
Question 3
You used a sunspots dataset that was stored in CSV. What’s the name of the Python library used to read CSVs?



1 / 1 point

CommaSeparatedValues


PyFiles


PyCSV


CSV (yes)

Correct
4.
Question 4
If your CSV file has a header that you don’t want to read into your dataset, what do you execute before iterating through the file using a ‘reader’ object?



1 / 1 point

reader.next


reader.ignore_header()


reader.read(next)


next(reader) (yes)

Correct
5.
Question 5
When you read a row from a reader and want to cast column 2 to another data type, for example, a float, what’s the correct syntax?



1 / 1 point

float f = row[2].read()


You can’t. It needs to be read into a buffer and a new float instantiated from the buffer


float(row[2]) (yes)


Convert.toFloat(row[2])

Correct
6.
Question 6
What was the sunspot seasonality?



1 / 1 point

11 years


22 years


4 times a year


11 or 22 years depending on who you ask (yes)

Correct
7.
Question 7
After studying this course, what neural network type do you think is best for predicting time series like our sunspots dataset?



1 / 1 point

A combination of all of the above (yes)


RNN / LSTM


DNN


Convolutions

Correct
8.
Question 8
Why is MAE a good analytic for measuring accuracy of predictions for time series?



1 / 1 point

It doesn’t heavily punish larger errors like square errors do (yes)


It biases towards small errors


It only counts positive errors


It punishes larger errors 

Correct
