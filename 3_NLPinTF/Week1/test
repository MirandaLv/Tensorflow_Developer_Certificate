Question 1
What is the name of the object used to tokenize sentences?

1 / 1 point

Tokenizer (Yes)


CharacterTokenizer


TextTokenizer


WordTokenizer

Correct

Question 2
What is the name of the method used to tokenize a list of sentences?

1 / 1 point

fit_to_text(sentences)


tokenize(sentences)


fit_on_texts(sentences) (Yes)


tokenize_on_text(sentences)

Correct

Question 3
Once you have the corpus tokenized, what’s the method used to encode a list of sentences to use those tokens?

1 / 1 point

texts_to_tokens(sentences)


text_to_sequences(sentences)


text_to_tokens(sentences)


texts_to_sequences(sentences) (Yes)

Correct

Question 4
When initializing the tokenizer, how to you specify a token to use for unknown words?

1 / 1 point

out_of_vocab=<Token>


unknown_token=<Token>


unknown_word=<Token>


oov_token=<Token> (Yes)

Correct

Question 5
If you don’t use a token for out of vocabulary words, what happens at encoding?

1 / 1 point

The word isn’t encoded, and is skipped in the sequence (Yes)


The word is replaced by the most common token


The word isn’t encoded, and the sequencing ends


The word isn’t encoded, and is replaced by a zero in the sequence

Correct

Question 6
If you have a number of sequences of different lengths, how do you ensure that they are understood when fed into a neural network?

1 / 1 point

Specify the input layer of the Neural Network to expect different sizes with dynamic_length


Process them on the input layer of the Neural Netword using the pad_sequences property


Use the pad_sequences object from the tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence namespace (Yes)


Make sure that they are all the same length using the pad_sequences method of the tokenizer

Correct

Question 7
If you have a number of sequences of different length, and call pad_sequences on them, what’s the default result?

1 / 1 point

They’ll get padded to the length of the longest sequence by adding zeros to the end of shorter ones


They’ll get padded to the length of the longest sequence by adding zeros to the beginning of shorter ones (Yes)


Nothing, they’ll remain unchanged


They’ll get cropped to the length of the shortest sequence

Correct


Question 8
When padding sequences, if you want the padding to be at the end of the sequence, how do you do it?

1 / 1 point

Pass padding=’after’ to pad_sequences when initializing it


Call the padding method of the pad_sequences object, passing it ‘post’


Call the padding method of the pad_sequences object, passing it ‘after’


Pass padding=’post’ to pad_sequences when initializing it (Yes)

Correct
