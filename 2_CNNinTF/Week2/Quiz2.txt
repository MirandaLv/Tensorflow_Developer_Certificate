1.
Question 1
How do you use Image Augmentation in TensorFLow

1 / 1 point

You have to write a plugin to extend tf.layers


Using parameters to the ImageDataGenerator (Yes)


With the keras.augment API


With the tf.augment API

Correct
2.
Question 2
If my training data only has people facing left, but I want to classify people facing right, how would I avoid overfitting?

1 / 1 point

Use the ‘flip_vertical’ parameter around the Y axis


Use the ‘horizontal_flip’ parameter (Yes)


Use the ‘flip’ parameter


Use the ‘flip’ parameter and set ‘horizontal’

Correct
3.
Question 3
When training with augmentation, you noticed that the training is a little slower. Why?

1 / 1 point

Because the image processing takes cycles (Yes)


Because the training is making more mistakes


Because there is more data to train on


Because the augmented data is bigger

Correct
4.
Question 4
What does the fill_mode parameter do?

1 / 1 point

There is no fill_mode parameter


It creates random noise in the image


It attempts to recreate lost information after a transformation like a shear (Yes)


It masks the background of an image

Correct
5.
Question 5
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.

1 / 1 point

It gets overwritten, so be sure to make a backup


A copy is made and the augmentation is done on the copy


Nothing, all augmentation is done in-memory (Yes)


It gets deleted

Correct
6.
Question 6
How does Image Augmentation help solve overfitting?

1 / 1 point

It slows down the training process


It manipulates the training set to generate more scenarios for features in the images (Yes)


It manipulates the validation set to generate more scenarios for features in the images


It automatically fits features to images by finding them through image processing techniques

Correct
7.
Question 7
When using Image Augmentation my training gets...

1 / 1 point

Slower (Yes)


Faster


Stays the Same


Much Faster

Correct

Question 8
Using Image Augmentation effectively simulates having a larger data set for training.

1 / 1 point

False


True (Yes)

Correct
